# WeatherApp

Download the source code, It requires the following libraries
com.android.support:appcompat-v7:22.+
com.android.volley:volley:1.0.0
com.google.code.gson:gson:2.6.2
com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.1.1

As these are added as dependecies in gradle.properties they will be loaded.

Minimum version to run this App is IceCream Sandwich

Yet to be Done:
- A polished UI
- Saving the data to cache, as of now sending a request while loading the app. But OpenWeatherMap allow a single request in 10min.
- Forecast for multiple locations
- Content localization w.r.t the country.
- Identifying the current location and showing the weather forecast.
